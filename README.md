## üéØ Problem It Solves

Tired of your Downloads folder looking like this?
- `IMG_1234.jpg`
- `Screenshot 2025-01-05 at 10.23.45.png`
- `document(1).pdf`
- `untitled.docx`
- `download.zip`

This app intelligently renames them to:
- `Vacation_Beach_2025-01-05.jpg`
- `Screenshot_Xcode_2025-01-05.png`
- `Invoice_Apple_2025-01-05.pdf`
- `Document_Project_Proposal_2025-01-05.docx`
- `Archive_Source_Code_2025-01-05.zip`

## ‚ú® Features

### Smart Content Analysis
- **PDFs**: Extracts text to identify invoices, receipts, and documents
- **Images**: Uses Vision framework to extract text and understand content
- **Code Files**: Detects programming languages and patterns
- **Documents**: Analyzes content for meaningful titles

### Safe & Non-Destructive
- ‚úÖ **Only renames files** - never moves or deletes
- ‚úÖ **Waits 1 hour** before touching any file (configurable)
- ‚úÖ **Skips already descriptive names** - won't rename meaningful filenames
- ‚úÖ **All processing on-device** - no cloud, no privacy concerns

### Intelligent Naming
- Detects invoices and adds vendor names
- Recognizes receipts with merchant information
- Identifies vacation photos vs regular photos
- Extracts app names from screenshots

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: macOS Permissions

The app needs permission to access your Downloads folder. When you first run it:

1. Click the menu bar icon (document with arrow)
2. Click **"Request Permissions"** 
3. Select your Downloads folder in the dialog
4. Click **"Grant Access"**

The app will save this permission for future use. You can also grant permission through System Settings > Privacy & Security > Files and Folders if needed.
